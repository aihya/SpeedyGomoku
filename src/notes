Main points:
1. Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning
2. Heuristic search:

2.1. Eval(i, j) = ((AttackValue(i, j) * AttackFactor) + (DefenseValue(i, j)) * randomnessFactor
     - The attack factor will define the aggrissevness of the bot attack strategy.
     - The randomnessFactor will decide the dumbness of the bot.

2.2. Beam-search:
     - Limits the number of searched nodes depending on the current state of the game.
     - If the bot is winning, the beam-search width is reduced dramitically leaving only few nodes
       to search. Otherwise, the width is expanded the include more of the possible nodes.

2.3. Threats.
2.4. Thread evaluation.
2.5. Evaluation function
